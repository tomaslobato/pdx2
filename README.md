# PDX v2

A remake of my old project PDX, a tool for chatting with your PDF files with just an upload.
Made with $0, Typescript, NextJS 14 (React) for both frontend and backend, Cloudinary and PineconeDB for storing files, Langchain and Google Gemini for handling the AI model, and Tanstack Query for making requests to the backend.

TODO:
MD format on chat responses
